## Viewing Amazon CloudWatch metrics<a name="sms_stats_cloudwatch_metrics"></a>

Amazon SNS automatically collects metrics about your SMS message deliveries and pushes them to Amazon CloudWatch\. You can use CloudWatch to monitor these metrics and create alarms to alert you when a metric crosses a threshold\. For example, you can monitor CloudWatch metrics to learn your SMS delivery rate and your month\-to\-date SMS charges\.

For information about monitoring CloudWatch metrics, setting CloudWatch alarms, and the types of metrics available, see [Monitoring Amazon SNS topics using CloudWatch](sns-monitoring-using-cloudwatch.md)\.

## Viewing CloudWatch Logs<a name="sns-viewing-cloudwatch-logs"></a>

You can collect information about successful and unsuccessful SMS message deliveries by enabling Amazon SNS to write to Amazon CloudWatch Logs\. For each SMS message that you send, Amazon SNS writes a log that includes the message price, the success or failure status, the reason for failure \(if the message failed\), the message dwell time, and other information\.

**To enable and view CloudWatch Logs for your SMS messages**

1. Sign in to the [Amazon SNS console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/sns/home)\.

1. In the console menu, set the region selector to a [region that supports SMS messaging](sns-supported-regions-countries.md)\.

1. On the navigation panel, choose **Text messaging \(SMS\)**\.

1. On the **Mobile text messaging \(SMS\)** page, in the **Text messaging preferences** section, choose **Edit**\.

1. On the next page, expand the **Delivery status logging** section\.

1. For **Success sample rate**, specify the percentage of successful SMS deliveries for which Amazon SNS will write logs in CloudWatch Logs\. For example:
   + To write logs only for failed deliveries, set this value to 0\.
   + To write logs for 10% of your successful deliveries, set it to 10\.

   If you don't specify a percentage, Amazon SNS writes logs for all successful deliveries\.

1. To provide the required permissions, do one of the following:
   + To create a new service role, choose **Create new service role** and then **Create new roles**\. On the next page, choose **Allow** to give Amazon SNS write access to your account's resources\.
   + To use an existing service role, choose **Use existing service role** and then paste the ARN name in the **IAM role for successful and failed deliveries** box\.

     The service role you specify must allow write access to your account's resources\. For more information on creating IAM roles, see [Creating a role for an AWS service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-service.html#roles-creatingrole-service-console) in the *IAM User Guide*\. 

1. Choose **Save changes**\.

1. Back on the **Mobile text messaging \(SMS\)** page, go to the **Delivery status logs** section to view any available logs\.
**Note**  
Depending on the destination phone number's carrier, it can take up to 72 hours for delivery logs to appear in the Amazon SNS console\. 

## Example log for successful SMS delivery<a name="example-log-successful-sms-delivery"></a>

The delivery status log for a successful SMS delivery will resemble the following example:

```
{
    "notification": {
        "messageId": "34d9b400-c6dd-5444-820d-fbeb0f1f54cf",
        "timestamp": "2016-06-28 00:40:34.558"
    },

        "mcc": 310,
        "providerResponse": "Message has been accepted by phone carrier",
        "dwellTimeMs": 599,
        "dwellTimeMsUntilDeviceAck": 1344
    },
    "status": "SUCCESS"
}
```

## Example log for failed SMS delivery<a name="example-log-failed-sms-delivery"></a>

The delivery status log for a failed SMS delivery will resemble the following example:

```
{
    "notification": {
        "messageId": "1077257a-92f3-5ca3-bc97-6a915b310625",
        "timestamp": "2016-06-28 00:40:34.559"
    },
    "delivery": {

        "mcc": 0,
        "providerResponse": "Unknown error attempting to reach phone",
        "dwellTimeMs": 1420,
        "dwellTimeMsUntilDeviceAck": 1692
    },
    "status": "FAILURE"
}
```
